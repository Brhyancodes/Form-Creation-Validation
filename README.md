In this project, I will develop a user registration form with validation and fetch user data from a public API. This project will enhance my understanding of form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript.

I will learn how to:
Validate form inputs using JavaScript.
Dynamically interact with HTML elements.
Fetch and display data from a public API.
Provide real-time feedback to users.
